# Work-Day-Scheduler

When the button is clicked, the planner is supposed to open on the current Day. Having difficutly figuring out how to hide all of my divs (the rows that will show the text I save). 

I am really having a tough time with this project. I think I need to go back and review several panopto videos from the last two weeks.
